Concepts
    CTM
        Object on webpages are controlled with a current transform matrix. Transformations cascade as they are
        applied to groups above the element, the CTM is the result of all those transformations.
        If (x1, y1) is a pixel in the untransformed object, and (x2, y2) is where that pixel end up after being 
        worked on by the CTM, the way (x2, y2) is calculated is with
            [a c e][x1]   [x2]
            [b d f][y1] = [y2]
            [0 0 1][ 1]   [ 1]
