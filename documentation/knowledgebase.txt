        Array
            Add to beginning: array.push()
            Add to end:       array.unshift()

    Python
        if __name__ == "__main__": exists so that you can call separate files without executing their top level code
        
        for()
            for item in list: 
                iterates over all the items in the list
            for idx, item in enumerate(list): 
                iterates over all the items in the list and allows you to reference the index

        super() 
            super() with no parameters refers to the subclass's superclass
            super() takes two optional parameters, the subclass and an instance of the subclass 
            
            ex. class SubClass(SuperClass):
                    def __init__(): super(SubClass, self).(...)
                
            In this example the super call is equivalent to a parameterless call

            ex. class SubClass(SuperClass):
                    def __init__(): super(SuperClass, self).(...)

            In this example the call to super searches in the super class of the super class

        pandas
            dataframe.shape returns (length, width) of the dataframe



Concepts
    CTM
        Object on webpages are controlled with a current transform matrix. Transformations cascade as they are
        applied to groups above the element, the CTM is the result of all those transformations.
        If (x1, y1) is a pixel in the untransformed object, and (x2, y2) is where that pixel end up after being 
        worked on by the CTM, the way (x2, y2) is calculated is with
            [a c e][x1]   [x2]
            [b d f][y1] = [y2]
            [0 0 1][ 1]   [ 1]
